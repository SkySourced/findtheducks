# Duck Mafia

## setup
- [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Clone repository
- Navigate to repository folder in terminal
- Run `npm install`
- To start server run `npm run devStart`
- Any saved changes will automatically restart the server, but you will need to refresh the page to see them
- Server will appear on localhost with the port in .ENV (default <http://localhost:3000>)
- No database commands will work until you DM me your [public IP](https://www.whatismyip.com/) and I set it in azure (still not paying of course)
- This will not work because you need a file called .ENV with all the secrets inside, dm me for that too
