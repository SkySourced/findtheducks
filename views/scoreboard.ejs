        <p>players are ranked by the amount of ducks they have found before anyone else. this means that removing or otherwise defacing ducks does not grant any advantage. it's a game, we're in it to have fun.</p>
        <p>we also reserve the right to remove any player from the game if they attempt to gain an unfair advantage.</p>
