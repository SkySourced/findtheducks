        <h1>27-08-23 breach</h1>
        <div class="alert alert-warning">TL;DR: We got ransomwared, and usernames, emails, and password hashes are compromised and may be leaked</div>
        <h3>What happened</h3>
        <p>In the afternoon of the 27th of August, during the process of transitioning the database to our own servers, one of our engineers (kind of) updated the main database password to <code>postgres</code>. Less than a minute later, they realised their mistake and changed to a secure password. In that time, an attacker entered the database, and copied & deleted our main database.</p>
        <p>We have a backup process in place, including the files obtained during the transfer process from the Azure servers. When we discovered the attack this morning, (28/08) we ensured the attacker had no more entry vectors, before removing the attackers message and restoring our data.</p>
        <h3>Result</h3>
        <p>All our user data is in hostile hands. The attacker has access to:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Username</b></li>
                <li><b>Email</b></li>
                <li><b>Password hash</b></li>
                <li>Permissions integer</li>
                <li>Finds & first finds</li>
                <li>Email verification uuids</li>
                <li>Password reset uuids</li>
            </ul>
            All email verification and password reset information has thankfully expired, so the attacker has not been able to use this to gain access to any accounts.
        </p>
        <p>If you see an uptick in spam email to your associated email, sorry about that.</p>
